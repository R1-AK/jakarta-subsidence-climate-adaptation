
# North Jakarta Submergence Analysis: Historical Trends and Future Projections

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the combined impact of land subsidence and sea level rise on North Jakarta, 
projecting when different areas of the city will sink below sea level under various scenarios. North Jakarta
has experienced severe land subsidence for decades due to groundwater extraction, urbanization, and natural
compaction, combined with accelerating sea level rise due to climate change.

## Key Findings

### Historical Trends (1974-2024)

- **Land Subsidence**: North Jakarta has sunk approximately **554.0 cm** in the past 50 years.
- **Sea Level Rise**: Sea levels in Jakarta Bay have risen by **15.8 cm** since 1993.
- **Combined Effect**: The total elevation change is **569.7 cm** lower relative to sea level.

### Projections for North Jakarta Submergence

#### Worst-Case Scenario (High emissions + Business as usual subsidence)
- **Coastal Areas (Zone 1)**: Sink below sea level by **1993**.
- **Urban Core (Zone 3)**: Sink below sea level by **1993**.
- By 2050, approximately **45-60%** of North Jakarta's area could be below sea level.

#### Most Likely Scenario (Medium emissions + Moderate intervention)
- **Coastal Areas (Zone 1)**: Sink below sea level by **1993**.
- **Urban Core (Zone 3)**: Sink below sea level by **1993**.
- By 2050, approximately **25-40%** of North Jakarta's area could be below sea level.

#### Best-Case Scenario (Low emissions + Strong intervention)
- **Coastal Areas (Zone 1)**: Sink below sea level by **1993**.
- **Urban Core (Zone 3)**: submerges by 1993.
- By 2050, less than **15%** of North Jakarta's area would be below sea level, primarily in low-lying coastal zones.

## Implications

1. **Without Intervention**: North Jakarta will face catastrophic flooding, displacement of millions of residents, 
   and loss of critical infrastructure by mid-century, with substantial areas below sea level by 2050.

2. **With Strong Intervention**: Implementing comprehensive groundwater management, switching to alternative water sources,
   and global climate mitigation could significantly delay submergence of key urban areas, potentially saving much of the city.

3. **Critical Timeline**: The analysis indicates that the next **10-15 years** represent a critical window for implementing
   effective interventions before large-scale irreversible submergence begins.

## Methodology

This analysis combined historical subsidence data from InSAR, GPS, and leveling surveys with sea level records from tide gauges
and satellite altimetry. Future projections use IPCC AR6 sea level rise scenarios combined with subsidence models based on
different policy intervention levels. Elevation zones were defined based on current topography of North Jakarta.

## Conclusion

The analysis confirms that parts of North Jakarta will inevitably sink below sea level in coming decades, with the
first significant areas submerging between 2030-2040. However, the extent and timing of submergence varies dramatically
based on both climate change mitigation and local subsidence reduction efforts. Strong interventions could save
substantial portions of the city from submergence through the end of the century.
